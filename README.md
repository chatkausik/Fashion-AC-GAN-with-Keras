# Creating A Generative Adversarial Network using Keras with Fashion MNIST

In this article, we will learn how to build a GAN from scratch using Convolution layers. For demonstration and quick work out, we will be using the Fashion MNIST dataset. Before going into details I want you to think, Can we use Deep learning to create something from nothing? To answer this question we are going to implement a GAN and see the results with our own eyes.

GAN is a unification of two Neural networks: Generator and Discriminator. The generator, generates new data instances, while the other, the discriminator, evaluates them for authenticity; i.e. the discriminator decides whether each instance of data that it reviews belongs to the actual training dataset or not. Now, let us implement and see it ourself.
